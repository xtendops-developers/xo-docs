Key terminology and concepts for the XtendOps platform.

## Core Concepts

### SmartAgent

BPO-focused AI agents designed to handle customer interactions. SmartAgents are configurable workflows built with modular steps that can be deployed for automated or human-augmented use cases.

**Deployment Options:**
- **Automated** - Via API for fully automated customer interactions
- **Human-Augmented** - Via SmartAgent App (Co-Pilot or Mission Control) for agent assistance

### XtendOps Platform

The main platform (xoos.xtendops.com) where users build, manage, and monitor SmartAgents.

**Key Features:**
- SmartAgent Builder - Visual workflow editor
- Testing & Evals - Performance validation
- Knowledge Management - Article repository
- Dashboard - Metrics and analysis
- Quality - Conversation review
- Settings - User and integration management

### SmartAgent App

The end-user interface for accessing SmartAgents, available in two form factors:

**Co-Pilot** - AI-suggested responses embedded in CRMs (Zendesk, Genesys). Agents review, edit, and send suggestions.

**Mission Control** - Chrome extension providing conversational AI assistance with context awareness of the current webpage.

### Client Account

An isolated workspace for a specific customer organization.

**Characteristics:**
- Dedicated SmartAgents, metrics, and settings
- Account-specific access permissions
- Data isolated from other client accounts

## Conversation Components

### Conversation

The parent container for all back-and-forth messages between a single user and the system. A conversation maintains context across multiple message exchanges.

### Message

An individual input from a customer into the AI, grouped into a Conversation. Each message triggers SmartAgent processing and generates a response.

### Background Context

Conversation-level information available to a SmartAgent for subsequent runs.

**Sources:**
- May be passed from a provider
- Extracted via AI
- Used to maintain continuity and context across multiple messages in a conversation

## SmartAgent Components

### Step

Modular building blocks that execute specific tasks within a SmartAgent workflow. Steps can include LLM processing, API calls, knowledge searches, structured output, routing, and more.

### SmartAction

Reusable, task-specific workflows that can be triggered by agents, SmartAgents, or timers. Available in both Co-Pilot and Mission Control via `/<action-name>` commands.

## Performance Metrics

### Feedback Score

Performance metric for Co-Pilot use cases that measures how closely the AI-generated response matches the final message sent by the agent. Calculated by comparing the original AI draft with the modified agent version.

**High Score:** Agent sent with minimal changes
**Low Score:** Significant agent edits required

### Resolution Score

Metric for automated use cases that measures conversations resolved without escalation to a human agent.

## Testing & Quality

### Eval

A group of test messages used to evaluate SmartAgent performance. Evals can be created from real conversation data and tailored for specific scenarios (e.g., greetings, resolutions) or represent a comprehensive sampling of conversation types.

[Create and manage evals →](/platform/evals)

### Run

The execution of an Eval against one or more SmartAgent versions, producing performance metrics and comparison data.

### Test

An individual message within an eval dataset.

## Technical Concepts

### Background Context

Conversation-level information maintained across multiple message exchanges within a SmartAgent.

**Sources:**
- Passed from external providers
- Extracted via AI processing
- Set programmatically (e.g., `smartagent__conversation_summary` for Co-Pilot Summary Section)

### Semantic Similarity

Measures how closely two pieces of text match in meaning, regardless of wording differences.

**Applications:**
- Knowledge article retrieval
- Voice of Customer analysis
- Conversation clustering

### Data Tags

Metadata assigned to conversations for reporting and filtering (e.g., intent, sentiment, product category, issue type).
