## Overview

Mission Control provides direct access to your organization's SmartAgents through an intuitive chat interface integrated as a Chrome extension. The extension is context-aware, understanding the webpage you're currently viewing to provide relevant assistance.

## Getting Started with AI in BPO Operations

- **No Integration Required**: Works independently when external system connections aren't available
- **Low Barrier to Entry**: Users can access AI assistance through a simple Chrome extension. Perfect for situations where embedding a SmartAgent in a CRM or other system is not available.

## Key Features

- **Multiple SmartAgents**: Access to several SmartAgents based on your permissions
- **Purpose-Built Assistants**: SmartAgents designed for specific use cases and workflows

### Reading the Current Page

You can add the current page's context to your conversation by clicking the read page button or using the keyboard shortcut (`⌘+⌥+R` on Mac or `Ctrl+Alt+R` on Windows).

</div>

Once the page is read, the content is added as context for your conversation, allowing the SmartAgent to provide more relevant and informed responses based on what you're currently viewing.

  />
</div>

### SmartActions

Any SmartActions configured for the SmartAgent you're using are available directly in Mission Control. Simply type `/<name of smartaction>` in the text input to trigger a SmartAction.

  />
</div>

**Example:**

```
/rephrase add emojis
```

This would execute the "rephrase" SmartAction and add emojis to the response if it's available for your current SmartAgent.
