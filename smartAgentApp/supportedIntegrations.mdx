### Zendesk

Embed Co-Pilot within Zendesk to provide your support agents with real-time suggested responses as they handle customer inquiries.

<Accordion title="Zendesk Installation Instructions">

This guide is provided by XtendOps to assist you in implementing Zendesk App. These apps facilitate streamlined customer interactions across various digital touchpoints. Our goal is to simplify the integration process for your team, offering clear steps to create, customize, and deploy them effectively within your platforms.

#### Requirements

- **Zendesk Subdomain** - Example: "xtendops1862" from `xtendops1862.zendesk.com`
- **Access to the Zendesk environment**
  - Email and password of an admin user
  - OR Email and API token of an admin user
- **A clientkey from XtendOps**
- **A zip file of the XtendOps app**

#### Step 1: Receive Materials from XtendOps

Obtain the following from XtendOps:

- `clientkey`
- Zip file of the XtendOps app

#### Step 2: Install ZCLI

Install the Zendesk CLI tool:

```bash
npm install @zendesk/zcli -g
```

For more information, visit the [ZCLI documentation](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/getting-started/using-zcli/).

#### Step 3: Login

Login to Zendesk CLI:

```bash
zcli login -i
```

Input prompts for:

- Subdomain
- Email
- Password

#### Step 4: Configure the App

1. Unpack the Zendesk app zip file
2. Navigate to the app directory in the CLI
3. Open `manifest.json`
4. Update the URL in `location.support.ticket_sidebar` to:
   ```
   https://agent-assist-staging.xtendops.com/app/zendesk?client_key=[clientkey]
   ```
   Replace `[clientkey]` with the key provided by XtendOps

**Note:** Remove `-staging` from the URL if pointing to production:

```
https://agent-assist.xtendops.com/app/zendesk?client_key=[clientkey]
```

#### Step 5: Upload the App

Validate and upload the app:

```bash
zcli apps:validate    # Check for errors
zcli apps:create      # Upload
```

A file `zcli.apps.config.json` will be generated with the `app_id` inside it.

#### Step 6: Update the App (Optional)

To update the app after initial upload:

1. Update `manifest.json` (like in Step 4)
2. Ensure the `app_id` is correct in `zcli.apps.config.json`
3. Validate and update:
   ```bash
   zcli apps:validate    # Check for errors
   zcli apps:update      # Update
   ```

#### Step 7: Control App Access

Configure which users or groups have access to the app. View [Zendesk's support documentation](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408832188442-Managing-access-to-apps) on how to assign to groups or roles.
