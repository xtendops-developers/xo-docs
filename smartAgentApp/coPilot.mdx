The **Co-Pilot App** is the interface agents use when working with a Co-Pilot SmartAgent. It is typically embedded into external provider platforms such as Gladly, Salesforce, and Zendesk .

## Overview

The Co-Pilot App streamlines agent workflows, enhances AI-assisted messaging, and provides quick access to contextual tools. It operates as a side-by-side assistant, suggesting responses that agents can review, edit, and send.

## Interface Components

### Summary Section

Displays dynamic, high-priority information to help agents make informed decisions quickly.

<Info>
To write data to the Summary Section, set the output variable or [structured output](/steps/structured-output) variable to the background context variable `smartagent__conversation_summary`. Whatever is written as the value for this variable will be displayed in the Summary Section. Markdown language is supported for formatting.
</Info>

**Content Types:**

- Customer information
- Order details
- Conversation history summary
- Relevant policies or procedures
- Priority indicators

**Dynamic Updates:**
Content swaps based on conversation context, showing what's most relevant at each stage.

### Edit Window

Shows the AI-suggested response that agents can edit before sending.

**Features:**

- Full text editing capabilities
- Formatting options (bold, italic, lists)
- Character/word count
- Preview mode

**Agent Actions:**

- Edit directly in the window
- Accept as-is
- Request regeneration
- Trigger SmartActions for modifications

**Quality Assurance:**
Agents ensure accuracy, tone, and compliance with guidelines before sending.

### SmartActions

Any SmartActions configured for the SmartAgent you're using are available directly in Mission Control. Simply type `/<name of smartaction>` in the text input to trigger a SmartAction.

**Example:**

```
/rephrase add emojis
```

This would execute the "rephrase" SmartAction and add emojis to the response if it's available for your current SmartAgent.

## Agent Workflow

**1. Customer Message Arrives**

Agent receives customer inquiry in their platform.

**2. AI Generates Suggestion**

Co-Pilot SmartAgent processes the message and generates a suggested response.

**3. Agent Reviews**

Agent sees:

- AI-suggested response in Edit Window
- Relevant context in Summary Section
- Available SmartActions

**4. Agent Edits (If Needed)**

Agent may:

- Accept as-is
- Make minor edits
- Trigger SmartActions to modify
- Regenerate entirely

**5. Agent Sends**

After review, agent sends the final message to the customer.

**6. Feedback Collected**

System calculates **Feedback Score** comparing:

- AI-generated draft
- Final sent message

### Best Practices

1. **Review Before Sending** - Always verify AI suggestions for accuracy
2. **Use SmartActions** - Leverage commands for common modifications
3. **Provide Feedback** - Help improve AI quality with thumbs up/down
4. **Edit When Needed** - Don't send if something feels off
5. **Learn Patterns** - Notice what works well and share with team

## Performance Metrics

### Feedback Score

Measures how closely the AI-generated response matches the final message sent by the agent.

**High Score:**

- Agent sent AI suggestion with minimal changes
- Indicates high AI quality
- Reduces agent effort

**Low Score:**

- Agent made significant edits
- AI suggestion may need improvement
- Opportunity for SmartAgent optimization

## Access Control

Co-Pilot App access is controlled in two ways depending on how it's being accessed:

### CRM Integration

When Co-Pilot is embedded in a CRM platform (see [Supported Integrations](/smartAgentApp/supportedIntegrations)), access is controlled by the CRM itself:

- Permissions managed within the external system (Zendesk, Genesys, etc.)
- Users access Co-Pilot through their existing CRM workflows
- Access follows the CRM's role-based permissions

### Chrome Extension

When accessed via the Chrome extension, access is controlled by user permissions in the XtendOps platform:

- Users must be assigned the **Agent** role in the platform
- Access limited to the Co-Pilot App only
- No access to SmartAgent Builder or other platform features
