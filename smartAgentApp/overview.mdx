SmartAgents built in the XtendOps platform are accessible to users in two form factors:

## Co-Pilot

Co-Pilot offers suggested responses to customer inquiries. It integrates directly into your existing support workflows, providing AI-powered assistance to help agents respond faster and more accurately.

## Mission Control

Mission Control gives users access to purpose-built automated SmartAgents that they can chat with to assist with their daily tasks. These conversational assistants help streamline operations and automate routine workflows.

Choose the form factor that best fits your use case, or use both to maximize the value of your SmartAgents.
