SmartAgents built in the XtendOps platform are accessible to users in two form factors:

## Co-Pilot

Co-Pilot offers suggested responses to customer inquiries. It integrates directly into your existing support workflows, providing AI-powered assistance to help agents respond faster and more accurately.
