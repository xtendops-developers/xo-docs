**Settings** provides centralized configuration for user access, external connections, and AI model keys. This is the administrative hub for your XtendOps workspace.

<Info>The settings page is only accessible to admins.</Info>

## Overview

Settings is organized into tabs that manage different aspects of your workspace configuration, from user permissions to API integrations to AI provider keys.

## Tabs

### Users

User management for the workspace.

**User Roles:**

- **Admin** - Full platform access including user, integration, and AI key management
- **Customer** - View-only access to SmartAgents, Quality, Knowledge Management, and Reporting
- **Builder** - Full platform access except for settings

**Authentication Methods:**

Users authenticate based on their email domain:

- **XtendOps Domains** (`@xtendops.us` or `@xolatam.com`) - Must use Google SSO
- **All Other Domains** - Username/Password authentication

**Multi-Account Access:**

Users can be added to multiple client accounts but maintain a single role across all accounts. When adding an existing user, the system will display their current permissions after you enter their email address.

**User Management Features:**

- Invite new users
- Assign/change roles
- Enable/disable accounts
- View last login times
- Track user activity

### Integrations

Secure storage for external API credentials used by the REST API Call step in SmartAgent Builder.

**Purpose:**
Store secrets here and reference them from the REST step instead of pasting raw tokens in the builder.

**Benefits:**

- **Improved Security** - Credentials stored separately from workflows
- **Easier Rotation** - Update credentials without modifying SmartAgents
- **Centralized Management** - One place for all API credentials
- **Access Control** - Limit who can view/edit credentials

**Supported Authentication Types:**

- API Keys
- Bearer Tokens
- OAuth credentials
- Basic Auth
- Custom headers

**Integration Examples:**

- Salesforce
- Zendesk
- Shopify
- Custom internal APIs
- Payment gateways

### AI Keys

Central place to register AI provider keys to enable usage tracking and cost/usage reporting by model.

**Supported Providers:**

- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Azure OpenAI

### Command Center

Still a work in progress. This allows you to administer what XtendOps employees can access the SmartAgent Extension. Further documentation should be provided once this feature is fully implemented.
