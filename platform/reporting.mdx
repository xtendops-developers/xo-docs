**Reporting** provides comprehensive insights into SmartAgent performance through quantitative metrics and qualitative conversation analysis.

## Overview

The Reporting section combines general performance reports with Voice of the Customer insights. General reports show key metrics like volume per day and average feedback scores, while Voice of the Customer reveals the _why_ behind the numbers by analyzing actual customer conversations.

### Top Trending Topics

Displays the most discussed topics from the past seven days.

**Automatically identifies:**

- Emerging issues
- Popular questions
- Common complaints
- Feature requests

### Chat History

Shows questions and conversations asked by other users in the account, allowing quick access to shared insights.

**Benefits:**

- Avoid duplicate analyses
- Learn from others' queries
- Build on existing insights
- Share discoveries

### How It Works

**Conversation Sampling**

The platform samples conversations that flow through the system.

**AI Summarization**

AI summarizes these conversations and assigns **data tags** to assist with reporting and filtering.

Data Tags:

- Intent (e.g., order_status, return_request)
- Sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
- Product category
- Issue type
- Resolution status

**Indexing**

Conversations become available for Voice of the Customer queries.

**Query Process**

When you ask a question, the system filters by intent, data tags, date range, and SmartAgent. It then performs a semantic search against conversation summaries, aggregates conversations exceeding a similarity threshold, and generates a summarized insight from the compiled results.

### Advanced Capabilities

#### Adjust Thresholds

Refine result specificity by changing similarity thresholds.

**Lower Threshold:**

- More conversations included
- Broader insights
- May include less relevant results

**Higher Threshold:**

- Fewer, more relevant conversations
- More specific insights
- May miss edge cases

#### Follow-Up Questions

Ask follow-up questions to dig deeper into the data.

**Example Flow:**

1. "What are common shipping complaints?"
2. "Which products have the most shipping issues?"
3. "What specific problems are customers reporting?"

#### View Source Conversations

Access source conversations that contributed to the summarized response for transparency and validation.

**Benefits:**

- Verify AI interpretations
- See actual customer language
- Identify outliers
- Extract specific quotes

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor General Reports** - Track volume and feedback scores to identify trends
2. **Explore with Voice of the Customer** - Use general reports to identify anomalies, then explore why with conversational insights
3. **Review Regularly** - Check both quantitative and qualitative data consistently
