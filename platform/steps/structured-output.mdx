The **Structured Output** step uses AI to extract and transform unstructured data into well-defined, structured JSON formats.

## Overview

The Structured Output step analyzes text (like customer messages or documents) and extracts specific information into a predefined schema. This is useful for parsing customer requests, extracting entities, or converting free-form text into structured data that can be used in subsequent steps or API calls.

## Settings

### LLM

Select the LLM provider for this step. Only providers that support structured output are available.

**Supported providers:**
- OpenAI
- Azure

### LLM Model

Choose the specific model to use. Recommended models provide the best balance of cost and performance.

**Recommended:** gpt-4o-mini (OpenAI)

### User Prompt

The prompt that instructs the LLM on what information to extract and how to structure it. Include relevant context and variables.

**Example:**
```
Extract meeting details from the following text:

{customer_message}

Identify the meeting name, date, and participants.
```

### Schema Properties

Define the structure of the output JSON object. Each property specifies a field name and its data type.

**Property format:**
```json
{
  "type": "string|number|boolean|array|object"
}
```

**Example schema:**
```json
meeting_name: { "type": "string" }
date: { "type": "string" }
participants: { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }
```

The LLM will extract data matching this schema from the input text.

## Output

### Spread Result

When enabled, each schema property is saved as a separate variable in the background context instead of a single nested object.

**Example:**
- Disabled: Access via `{output.meeting_name}`
- Enabled: Access via `{meeting_name}`

### Outputs

Name of the variable where the structured output will be saved. Can be referenced in subsequent steps.

**Default:** `structured_output`

### Next Steps

The step(s) to execute after this step completes. Select from existing steps or enter a custom step name using variables.

## Advanced Options

### Follow Up Steps

Steps that run in parallel after this step completes. Use this for actions that don't need to block the workflow, such as logging or analytics.

### Background Steps

Steps that run in the background while the main workflow continues. Useful for long-running tasks that shouldn't delay the response.

### Write Outputs to BG Context

When enabled, saves the step output to the background context, making it available to all subsequent steps in the conversation without explicitly passing it.

### System Prompt

Advanced system-level instructions for the LLM. Generally not needed for standard use cases.

## Common Use Cases

### Extract Customer Intent and Details
Parse customer messages to identify what they want and relevant details.

**Schema:**
```json
intent: { "type": "string" }
order_number: { "type": "string" }
urgency: { "type": "string" }
```

### Parse Form Data
Convert free-text responses into structured fields.

**Schema:**
```json
full_name: { "type": "string" }
email: { "type": "string" }
phone: { "type": "string" }
preferred_contact_method: { "type": "string" }
```

### Extract Meeting Information
Pull structured data from meeting descriptions.

**Schema:**
```json
meeting_title: { "type": "string" }
date: { "type": "string" }
time: { "type": "string" }
attendees: { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }
```

### Classify and Tag Content
Categorize and tag customer inquiries or documents.

**Schema:**
```json
category: { "type": "string" }
priority: { "type": "string" }
tags: { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }
```
