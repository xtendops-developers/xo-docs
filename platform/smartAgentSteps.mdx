**Steps** are modular building blocks that can be mixed, matched, and connected together to form workflows for a specific SmartAgent.

## Steps on the Canvas

Each step type has a distinct appearance on the canvas with unique icons and display of relevant information for quick awareness. Steps on the canvas include controls for testing individual steps and the ability to group child steps together for better workflow organization.

### Grouping Steps

Grouping steps together allows you to create a single step that can be tested and deployed as a unit. This is useful for complex workflows that need to be tested and deployed as a single unit.

### Testing Steps

Testing steps allows you to test the step before it is deployed to the workflow. This is useful for ensuring that the step is working as expected before it is deployed to the workflow.

## Step Structure

Each step in the SmartAgent builder is organized into three main sections:

### Settings

The Settings section contains configuration options specific to the currently selected step type.

- Manipulation of input parameters
- Step-specific options

### Outputs

The Outputs section allows you to:

- Name the step's output variable
- Determine what happens next in the workflow
- Control if the steps output is sent to the user

### Advanced Settings

The Advanced Settings section provides additional running options for specialized use cases, such as:

- Running steps in parallel
- Custom execution configurations
