The **SmartAgent Builder** is the primary workspace for creating and modifying SmartAgents. It provides a visual canvas where you can configure workflows, connect steps, and deploy new versions.

## Overview

**SmartAgent Builder** is the primary workspace for creating and modifying SmartAgents. It provides a visual canvas where you can configure workflows, connect steps, and deploy new versions.

**Key Features:**

- Visual workflow canvas
- Step configuration
- Step connection management
- Version control and deployment
- Testing capabilities (Step Simulation and Play All)

The builder utilizes the [Steps](/steps/smartAgentSteps) library to create workflows.

## Building Workflows

SmartAgent workflows are built by connecting modular steps together. Each step performs a specific function, and together they form a complete conversation flow.

The builder provides:

- **Chain View** - Sequential list of steps in the workflow
- **Canvas View** - Visual representation of step connections and flow
- **Version Management** - Create, test, and deploy different versions
- **Events** - Configure triggers like "On Conversation Start" or "On First Generation Complete"

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple** - Begin with a basic flow and add complexity incrementally
2. **Test Frequently** - Use Step Simulation and Play All to validate changes
3. **Version Control** - Create new versions for significant changes
4. **Use Events Wisely** - Leverage conversation events for context preparation
5. **Document Changes** - Keep track of what each version changes
