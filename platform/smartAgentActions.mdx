**Quick Actions** are reusable, task-specific workflows that can be triggered by agents, SmartAgents, or timers. They provide modular functionality that extends SmartAgent capabilities without cluttering the main conversation flow.

## Overview

Quick Actions enable you to create focused, purpose-built workflows that can be invoked on-demand or automatically based on triggers. They're designed to improve efficiency, consistency, and response quality.

## Triggers

Quick Actions can be initiated in multiple ways:

### Manual Triggers

- Agents can trigger Quick Actions directly from the Co-Pilot App
- SmartAgents can call Quick Actions programmatically

### Timer-Based Triggers

- **After Agent Message** - Trigger 1 minute after an agent sends a message
- **After Inactivity** - Trigger after 3 minutes of customer inactivity
- **Custom Timers** - Configure specific timing conditions

### Programmatic Triggers

- Invoke Quick Actions from within SmartAgent workflows
- Call from external systems via API

## Common Use Cases

### Response Suggestions

Generate suggested responses for human agents to review and send.

**Example:**

- Agent receives a complex customer inquiry
- Quick Action analyzes the message and suggests a response
- Agent reviews, edits, and sends

### Tone Adjustment

Rephrase AI-generated responses to match desired tone.

**Example:**

- AI generates a response that seems too formal
- Agent triggers "Make Friendlier" Quick Action
- Response is rephrased with emojis and casual language

### CRM Updates

Update external systems like Salesforce automatically.

**Example:**

- Conversation reaches resolution
- Quick Action updates case status in CRM
- Logs conversation summary and tags

### Inactivity Follow-ups

Send automated follow-up messages after periods of customer silence.

**Example:**

- Customer hasn't responded in 3 minutes
- Quick Action triggers: "Are you still there? Let me know if you need anything else!"

### Data Extraction

Extract and structure information from conversations.

**Example:**

- Extract order number, issue type, and priority
- Format as structured data for downstream systems
- Update tracking dashboards

## Configuration

Quick Actions are configured in the **SmartAction Configuration** tab of the SmartAgent Builder.

**Configuration Options:**

- **Name** - Descriptive name for the action
- **Trigger Type** - Manual, timer-based, or programmatic
- **Workflow** - Chain of steps that execute when triggered
- **Permissions** - Which roles can trigger the action
- **Context** - What conversation data is available to the action

## Integration with Co-Pilot App

Quick Actions are directly accessible from the Co-Pilot App, allowing human agents to:

- View available Quick Actions
- Trigger actions via command line
- See results in real-time
- Edit AI-generated outputs before sending

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Actions Focused** - Each Quick Action should do one thing well
2. **Name Clearly** - Use descriptive names that indicate what the action does
3. **Set Appropriate Timers** - Don't trigger too quickly or too late
4. **Provide Context** - Ensure actions have access to necessary conversation data
5. **Test Thoroughly** - Validate Quick Actions work across different scenarios

## Purpose

Quick Actions provide tools for SmartAgents and human agents to:

- Improve efficiency
- Maintain consistency
- Enhance response quality
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Reduce agent workload
