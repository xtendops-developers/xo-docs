The **Knowledge Management** section is a tool for uploading and managing knowledge articles that can be referenced by SmartAgents during conversations.

## Overview

Knowledge Management provides a central repository of information that SmartAgents can search and retrieve to provide accurate, contextual responses. This ensures consistent information across all customer interactions.

## Purpose

Supports the **Knowledge Search** step by providing a centralized knowledge base that SmartAgents can query during interactions.

## Features

### Bulk Upload

Allows CSV or PDF uploads to quickly import knowledge articles.

**CSV Upload:** Import multiple knowledge articles at once with structured metadata.

**PDF Upload:** Upload PDF documents that are automatically parsed into content. The PDF content is extracted and stored as knowledge articles.

**CSV Format:**

The CSV file should include the following column headers:

- `title` - Article title
- `content` - Full article content
- `intent` - Intent or category classification
- `step_type` - Type of step or process
- `brand` - Brand or namespace for categorization

[Download Knowledge Base Template CSV](/platform/knowledge-base-template.csv)

**Tip:** Use the columns from your CSV upload (like `intent`, `step_type`, or `brand`) as filter key-value pairs in the [Knowledge Search step](/steps/knowledge-search) to retrieve specific articles. For example: `intent, FAQ` or `brand, XtendOps`.

**Benefits:**

- Quick migration from existing knowledge bases
- Batch updates across multiple articles
- Consistent formatting

### Article Management

Once uploaded, articles can be:

#### Viewed

- View complete article content within the Knowledge Management interface
- See usage statistics (how often retrieved)
- Review average feedback scores
- Track last updated date

#### Edited

- Update article content directly in the interface
- Modify titles and descriptions
- Adjust namespace assignments
- Update metadata

#### Tagged and Annotated

- Add metadata for improved search relevance
- Assign to namespaces for organization
- Tag with keywords
- Set priority or visibility flags

### Article Metrics

Track how knowledge articles are performing:

- **Usage Count** - How many times the article has been retrieved
- **Average Feedback** - Quality ratings from responses using this article
- **Last Updated** - When the article was last modified

## Usage in SmartAgents

Articles stored in Knowledge Management become available to any SmartAgent using the **Knowledge Search** step.

### Retrieval Methods

**Similarity Search:**

- Semantic matching based on conversation context
- Retrieve most relevant articles
- Rank by relevance score

**Combined Approach:**

- Apply filters first to narrow scope
- Use similarity search within filtered results
- Return top-ranked articles

## Best Practices

1. **Upload** - Add articles via CSV, PDF, or manual entry
2. **Keep Articles Focused** - One topic per article with clear titles
3. **Tag Comprehensively** - Use metadata columns to enable filtered searches
4. **Configure SmartAgent** - Add Knowledge Search steps to workflows
5. **Monitor Usage** - Track article usage and feedback scores
6. **Update Regularly** - Keep information current and retire outdated content
7. **Optimize** - Update or remove articles based on performance metrics
