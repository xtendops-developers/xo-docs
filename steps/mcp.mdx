## What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol that enables AI models to securely connect with external data sources and tools. Developed by Anthropic, MCP provides a standardized way for AI systems to interact with various resources while maintaining security and context awareness.

## How MCP Works

MCP acts as a universal adapter between AI models and external systems, allowing SmartAgents to:

- **Access External Data** - Query databases, APIs, and file systems
- **Use Tools** - Execute functions and operations in external systems
- **Maintain Context** - Share relevant information with the AI model
- **Ensure Security** - Control access and permissions through a standardized protocol
