The **Call SmartAgent** step allows one SmartAgent to call another, enabling modular, purpose-built designs for specific intents or functions.

## Overview

By calling other SmartAgents, you can break complex workflows into manageable, reusable components. Each SmartAgent can focus on a specific task (e.g., order lookup, returns processing, billing inquiries) and be called from multiple parent workflows.

## Settings

### SmartAgent

Select which SmartAgent to call from your account. This is the main SmartAgent that will be invoked.

### SmartAgent Version

Choose a specific version of the selected SmartAgent to call.

**Options:**
- **Use currently active version** - Always calls the production version currently marked as active
- **Select specific version** - Calls a specific version number (useful for testing draft versions)

**Best practice:** Enable "Use currently active version" for production workflows so updates to the called SmartAgent automatically take effect without modifying the parent workflow.

### Inputs

JSON object containing input variables to pass to the called SmartAgent. These variables become available to the called SmartAgent's steps.

**Format:** JSON key-value pairs

**Example:**
```json
{
  "order_id": "{order_number}",
  "customer_email": "{email}",
  "request_type": "status_check"
}
```

**Dynamic variables:** Use `{variable_name}` syntax to pass values from the current workflow.

### Mark as Escalated

When enabled, designates the called Copilot SmartAgent as the new handler for the conversation. The Copilot agent will be invoked immediately when joining and on subsequent messages.

**Note:** This option is only available when calling Copilot type SmartAgents from Automation SmartAgents.

## Outputs

### Outputs

Name of the variable where the called SmartAgent's output will be saved. Can be referenced in subsequent steps using `{variable_name}`.

### Next Steps

The step(s) to execute after the called SmartAgent completes. Select from existing steps or enter a custom step name using variables.

## Advanced Settings

### Write Outputs to BG Context

When enabled, saves the called SmartAgent's output to the background context, making it available to all subsequent steps in the conversation without explicitly passing it.

### Follow Up Steps

Steps that run in parallel after this step completes. Use this for actions that don't need to block the workflow, such as logging or analytics.

### Background Steps

Steps that run in the background while the main workflow continues. Useful for long-running tasks that shouldn't delay the response.

## Common Use Cases

### Modular Workflow Design
Break a complex SmartAgent into specialized sub-agents.

**Example:**
- Main: Customer Service Hub
- Sub-agents: Order Status Lookup, Return Processing, Billing Inquiries

### Reusable Components
Create a library of SmartAgents that can be called from multiple workflows.

**Examples:**
- Address Validation SmartAgent
- Payment Processing SmartAgent
- Customer Authentication SmartAgent

### Specialized Task Delegation
Route specific tasks to SmartAgents with specialized knowledge and integrations.

**Example:** When a customer asks about technical support, delegate to a Technical Support SmartAgent that has access to specialized knowledge bases and troubleshooting tools.
